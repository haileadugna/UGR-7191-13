                With a length of 15.1 km, Sof Omar Caves is Ethiopia's 
                longest cave. It is located east of Ginnir in the Oromia 
                Region's East Bale Zone, where the Weyib River (Gestro River) 
                runs. It disappears at the Ayiew Maco entrance and resurfaces 
                1km distant at the Holuca resurgence. Tradition says that 
                Sof Omar was the name of a local Muslim holy man, and Ayiew 
                was the name of his daughter. Local terms for "name" and "cave," 
                respectively, are Maco and Holuca. It has been a longtime center 
                for religion and is revered by both Islam and the indigenous 
                Oromo culture. The pillars in the caverns, especially in the 
                "Chamber of Columns," are what make them famous.

            <h2> Lalibela </h2>

            <p class="all-parg">
                Medieval monolithic churches were carved out of rock. Their building 
                is attributed to King Lalibela who set out to construct in the 12th 
                century a ‘New Jerusalem’, after Muslim conquests halted Christian 
                pilgrimages to the holy Land. Lalibela flourished after the decline 
                of the Aksum Empire. There are two main groups of churches – to the 
                north of the river Jordan: Biete Medhani Alem, Biete Mariam, Biete Maskal, 
                Biete Denagel, Biete Golgotha Mikael; and to the south of the river, 
                Biete Amanuel, Biete Qeddus Mercoreus, Biete Abba Libanos, 
                Biete Gabriel Raphael, and Biete Lehem. The eleventh church, Biete Ghiorgis, 
                is isolated from the others, but connected by a system of trenches.

            <h2>Axum tomb</h2>
            
            <p class="all-parg">The ruins of the ancient city of Aksum are found close to 
                Ethiopia's northern border. The Kingdom of Aksum was the 
                most powerful kingdom between the Eastern Roman Empire and Persia, 
                and these sites designate where the ancient Ethiopian capital once stood.
                The gigantic remains, which date from the first to the 13th centuries A.D., 
                contain monolithic obelisks, enormous stelae, royal tombs, and old castle ruins.
                Ethiopian rulers were still crowned there for a very long time after Aksum's
                political downfall in the 10th century.

                The Simien Mountains National Park in Northern Ethiopia is an exotic setting with 
                unique wildlife and breath-taking views on a landscape shaped by nature and traditional agriculture. 
                The natural beauties of this region have always filled visitors from Ethiopia and abroad with awe. 
                Gentle highland ridges at altitudes above 3600 meters above sea level (m asl), covered with grasses, 
                isolated trees (Erica &bored) and the bizarre Giant Lobelia (Lobelia rhynchopetalum) are found on the 
                high plateau that ends abruptly at 1000- to 2000-m deep escarpments. 
                The margins of this high plateau consist of precipitous cliffs and deep, canyon-style gorges.
