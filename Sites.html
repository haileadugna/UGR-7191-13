            <p class="content_field_all-parg">
                Sof Omar Caves is the longest cave in Ethiopia at 15.1 kilometres (9.4 mi) long. 
                When surveyed in 1972, it was the longest cave in Africa. Since then explorations 
                in Algeria (Rhar Bou Ma’za - the Tafna River Cave 18.4 km) and Madagascar 
                (Ambatoharanana - Crocodile Cave 18.1 km) have overtaken it. [1] It is situated 
                to the east of Robe, in the Bale Zone of the Oromia Region in southeastern Ethiopia, 
                through which the Weyib River (Gestro River) flows.[2] It sinks at the Ayiew Maco 
                entrance and reappears at the Holuca resurgence 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) away. According 
                to tradition Sof Omar was the name of a Muslim holy man who lived in the area and Ayiew 
                the name of his daughter. Maco and Holuca are local names for 'name' and "cave", respectively. 
                Long a religious centre, it is sacred both to Islam and the local Oromo traditional religion. 
                The caves are known for their many pillars, particularly in the "Chamber of Columns"

            <h2> Lalibela </h2>

            <p class="content_field_all-parg">
                In a mountainous region in the heart of Ethiopia, some 645 km from Addis Ababa, eleven medieval 
                monolithic churches were carved out of rock. Their building is attributed to King Lalibela who 
                set out to construct in the 12th century a ‘New Jerusalem’, after Muslim conquests halted Christian
                 pilgrimages to the holy Land. Lalibela flourished after the decline of the Aksum Empire. There are 
                 two main groups of churches – to the north of the river Jordan: Biete Medhani Alem (House of the 
                 Saviour of the World), Biete Mariam (House of Mary), Biete Maskal (House of the Cross), Biete Denagel 
                 (House of Virgins), Biete Golgotha Mikael (House of Golgotha Mikael); and to the south of the river, 
                 Biete Amanuel (House of Emmanuel), Biete Qeddus Mercoreus (House of St. Mercoreos), Biete Abba Libanos 
                 (House of Abbot Libanos), Biete Gabriel Raphael (House of Gabriel Raphael), and Biete Lehem (House of Holy Bread). 
                 The eleventh church, Biete Ghiorgis (House of St. George),
                 is isolated from the others, but connected by a system of trenches.

            <p class="content_field_all-parg">
                The ruins of the ancient city of Aksum are found close to Ethiopia's northern border. 
                They mark the location of the heart of ancient Ethiopia, when the Kingdom of Aksum was 
                the most powerful state between the Eastern Roman Empire and Persia. The massive ruins,
                 dating from between the 1st and the 13th century A.D., include monolithic obelisks, 
                 giant stelae, royal tombs and the ruins of ancient castles. Long after its political 
                 decline in the 10th century, 
                Ethiopian emperors continued to be crowned in Aksum.The so-called mausoleum has a monumental portal 
                (hewn from a single slab of granite) marking the tomb's entrance and is carved with the stelae's 
                curious false-door motifs. 
                The portal leads into a passageway with 10 chambers. In total the tomb covers some 240 sq metres.
                Yodit successfully destroyed the Empire of Axum and reigned over Ethiopia for four decades, and established 
                Hebrewism the religion of Sheba as a state ideology.

            <p class="content_field_all-parg">
                The Simien Mountains National Park in Northern Ethiopia is an exotic setting with unique wildlife 
                and breath-taking views on a landscape shaped by nature and traditional agriculture. The natural 
                beauties of this region have always filled visitors from Ethiopia and abroad with awe. 
                Gentle highland ridges at altitudes above 3600 meters above sea level (m asl), covered with grasses,
                 isolated trees (Erica &bored) and the bizarre Giant Lobelia (Lobelia rhynchopetalum) are found on 
                 the high plateau that ends abruptly at 1000- to 2000-m deep escarpments. The margins of this high 
                 plateau consist of precipitous cliffs and deep, canyon-style gorges. In some places, the escarpment 
                 forms small elevations that offer splendid natal lookout points. The spectacular views from the 
                 observation points at Gidir Got and lmet Gogo in the center of the Park offer unparalleled panoramas 
                 along the high plateau and down to the lowland areas. Given the right meteorological conditions, 
                 views reaching up to a hundred kilometers over the valleys and the terraces of the Tekeze lowland 
                 basin are no exception. Geologically speaking, 
                the entire highlands of the Simien mountains consist of dark Trapp basalt and bright, soft turf.
